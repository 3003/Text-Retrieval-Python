#Text Retrieval Python#
A collection of Python scripts with functions for Text Retrieval.

Search process:
- Users perform a **task** that has an **information need**, from which a **query** is formulated.
- A **search engine** processes textual queries and **retrieves** a **ranked** list of **documents**.
- Users obtain a **result** and may **reformulate** (refine) their query, based on **suggestions**.

##Ranking##
Search engines (used to) rank web documents based on features, such as:
- Term Frequency (In URL, pagetitle, body and metatags)
- TF-IDF
- BM25
- LSI
- Keyword Density
- Boolean models
- Vector space models
- PageRank
- Number of inbound links
- Number of outbound links
- Link quality
- Page quality
- Site quality
- Author quality
- Document length
- Number of slashes in URL
- Length of URL
- URL click count from user data
- URL click count on result pages
- URL dwell time
- Reading level

###Term Frequency - Inverted Document Frequency (TF-IDF)###
**TF-IDF** is the product of TF and IDF. A high TF-IDF means the term is highly related to a document.

**TF** or tf(t,d), can prevent bias to longer documents:
- Raw Frequency: Simply count the number of times the term/query appears in the document.
- Boolean Frequency: tf(t,d) = 1 if term in document, else tf(t,d) = 0
- Logarithmically Scaled Frequency: tf(t,d) = 1 + log f(t,d) if term in document, else tf(t,d) = 0
- Proportional Frequency: tf(t,d) = tf(t,d) / number of all terms in document
- Normalized Frequency: tf(t,d) = tf(t,d) / maximum raw frequency of any term in the document

To illustrate TF. We have 2 documents A and B: 
- Document A has 10 words and Document B has 100 words.
- The term "Alice" appears 1 time in document A. Proportional: tf(t,d) for document A = 1 / 10 = 0.1
- The term "Alice" appears 5 times in document B. Proportional: tf(t,d) for document B = 5 / 100 = 0.05

**IDF** or idf(t, docs), prevents bias to common words and values unique words:
- idf(t, docs): count all documents / Boolean frequency of the term in all documents.

To illustrate IDF. We have 20 documents. We have three words:
- a very common word, appears in all documents: IDF = 20 / 20 = 1
- a fairly common word, appears in half of the documents: IDF = 20 / 10 = 2
- a very rare word, appears in only 10% of documents: IDF = 20 / 2 = 10

####tfidf.py####
Functions:
- TF Raw
- TF Proportional
- IDF
- Very simple tokenizer

Sample output:

	Term: alice
	First 5 document tokens: ['alice', 'wunderland', '1009', 'tree', 'lane']
	Term count in document 1
	Token count in document: 6
	Number of documents: 3
	Number of documents with term: 2
	TF:         0.1666
	IDF:        1.5
	TFIDF:      0.25

##Evaluating Search Engine Results##
What makes for a good search engine? 

Mainly:
- Speed
- Size
- **Quality**

Optionally:
- Personalization
- Localization
- Customization
- Simplicity / UX
- Social
- Privacy

###Measuring Quality###
How de we assess the quality of a search engine result page (SERP)?
- Ask users and volunteers directly for feedback
- Hire SERP reviewers
- Measure user engagement (Number of clicks on result, Bounce ratio)
- A/B testing
- Multi-variate testing

Quality feedback can be binary (0 for not relevant, 1 for relevant) or non-binary (0-3 scale).

Example binary feedback for 15 results:

	[(1,1),(2,1),(3,1),(4,0),(5,1),(6,1),(7,1),(8,1),(9,1),(10,1),(11,0),(12,1),(13,0),(14,1),(15,0)]

(Rank 1, 2, 3 are relevant, rank 4 is irrelevant, rank 5 to 10 are relevant etc.)
